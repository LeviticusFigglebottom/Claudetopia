## Sedgemire's own place builders (docs/WORLD_LIFE.md). A POI def with `"builder": "<name>"` is built
## by the static function of that name here, in place of its kind's builder. Only the Sedgemire
## region's author edits this file, so six regions can build at once without meeting.
##
##   static func drovers_hall(d: PoiDressing) -> void:
##       await PoiDressing.kind_builders().LAND.farmstead(d)    # its kind's, then more
##       var k := d.kit                                          # PoiKit: on_ground, prop, masonry ...
##
## The kind stays the def's `kind` (what the tests, the map and the audit call it); a builder named
## here that is missing is said in the log and the place is built as its kind.
